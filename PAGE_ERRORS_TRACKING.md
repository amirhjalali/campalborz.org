## Common Import Errors

All broken pages are trying to import components that don't exist in the new structure:

### 1. Missing Components
- `@/components/layout/MainLayout` - Old layout wrapper component
- `@/components/ui/Card` - Old card component
- `@/components/ui/Button` - Old button component
- `@heroicons/react/24/outline` - Hero icons package (not installed)

### 2. Other Missing Dependencies
- `useTenant` hook - Old multi-tenant system hook
- Old UI component library structure

## Fix Strategy

### Option 1: Quick Fix - Redirect to Homepage (Temporary)
- Replace all broken pages with simple redirects
- Allows site to function while we rebuild

### Option 2: Full Redesign (Recommended)
- Redesign each page using new design system
- Consistent with homepage and art page
- Better user experience

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Pages (Priority)
1. **About Page** - Company information, mission, team
2. **Events Page** - Upcoming events, calendar
3. **Donate Page** - Donation options, impact metrics

### Phase 2: Community Pages
4. **Members Page** - Member portal, login
5. **Apply Page** - Application to join camp
6. **Culture Page** - Persian culture showcase

### Phase 3: Admin & Search
7. **Admin Page** - Admin dashboard
8. **Search Page** - Site search functionality

## New Design System Components Used

### Available Components
- `Navigation` - Top navigation bar with dropdowns
- `Hero` - Hero section with gradient background
- `Stats` - Statistics display section
- `FeatureCards` - Feature showcase cards

### Styling Utilities
- Tailwind CSS with custom theme

## ⚠️ VERIFICATION IN PROGRESS

### Important Note
Per CLAUDE.md instructions, pages should only be marked as "Working" after:
1. No compilation errors in terminal
2. Page loads successfully in browser
3. No console errors in browser DevTools

The fixes have been applied to remove old component dependencies, but server verification is still showing some cached errors. A server restart may be needed to clear the cache.

## Notes

- All pages should follow the Ethereum.org-inspired design
- Use Persian cultural elements consistently
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Add smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Keep loading times under 3 seconds
