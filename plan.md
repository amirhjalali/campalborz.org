# Camp Management Platform - Technical Implementation Plan

## Overview
Build a modern, multi-tenant camp management platform initially for Camp Alborz, designed from the ground up to be licensable to other Burning Man camps and festival organizations. The architecture will support white-labeling, customization, and scalable deployment while preserving all current Camp Alborz content from the OLD directory.

## Architecture Principles
- **Multi-tenant SaaS architecture** with isolated data per organization
- **White-label capabilities** for full brand customization
- **Configurable feature modules** that can be enabled/disabled per tenant
- **Abstract data models** that work for any camp/organization
- **Plugin architecture** for custom extensions
- **API-first design** for third-party integrations

## Licensing & Business Model

### Target Market
- **Primary**: Burning Man theme camps (500+ registered camps)
- **Secondary**: Music festivals, art collectives, community organizations
- **Enterprise**: Large-scale events and multi-camp organizations

### Pricing Tiers
- **Starter**: $29/month - Basic features for small camps (< 50 members)
- **Professional**: $99/month - Full features for medium camps (< 200 members)
- **Enterprise**: $299/month - Advanced features + white-label for large camps
- **Custom**: Enterprise solutions for multi-camp organizations

### Revenue Streams
1. **Subscription fees** - Monthly/annual recurring revenue
2. **Setup and onboarding** - One-time implementation fees
3. **Custom development** - Bespoke features and integrations
4. **Plugin marketplace** - Revenue sharing on third-party plugins
5. **Premium templates** - Marketplace for professional themes

### Competitive Advantages
- **Burning Man specialization** - Deep understanding of unique camp needs
- **Complete solution** - No need for multiple tools
- **Easy migration** - Import from existing systems
- **Community-driven** - Built by and for the Burning Man community
