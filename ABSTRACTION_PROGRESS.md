## üêõ Known Issues

### Pre-Existing Build Errors:
- **Admin page** (`/admin`) - Missing UI components
  - Missing: `../ui/select`, `../ui/tabs`
  - Missing: `react-dropzone` dependency
  - Missing: tRPC client setup
  - **Impact**: Admin page doesn't compile
  - **Solution**: Install deps or remove admin page
